# Weather Dashboard Project README

Welcome to the Weather Dashboard project! This web application provides you with the current weather and a 5-day forecast for any location you choose. It utilizes the Geocoding API from OpenWeatherMap to retrieve weather data.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Weather Dashboard project, follow these simple steps:

1. **Download the Project:** Clone or download the project repository from GitHub to your local machine.

3. **Run the Application:** Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser. The Weather Dashboard will load, allowing you to enter the location for which you want to view the weather forecast.

## Usage
Once the application is running, you can use the Weather Dashboard to:
